# 🛍️ Shop-n-Enjoy

**Shop-n-Enjoy** is a responsive shopping cart app built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Context API**.  
It simulates a real-world shopping experience — browse products, add to cart, view totals, and more — while helping me practice advanced React concepts like `useReducer`, `Context API`, `React Router`, and local storage.
